👋 Hey there!

My name is Derek. I have a passion or what some would call an obsession for everything Cloud Engineering, Software Development, and Automation. Be it projects or just daily tasks.  I truly love being able to hit the "big red easy button" 🔴  Reminiscent of a [Rube Goldberg Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine).  My motto is, if you can dream it 💭, you can build it 🛠!

I'm currently working on Software Development projects utilizing AWS, Azure and GCP Cloud based services.  Focusing on DevOps CI/CD methodology in Scalable Cloud Deployments. 🚀☁
