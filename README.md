I love unraveling tech puzzles and believe there is always multiple solutions to any problem. But it's not just about building something or fixing things. It's about finding the optimal performance and practical simplicity that scales with the least amount of maintenance and cost. That way you can focus on building more awesome stuff!


### 🍓 **What's My Jam:**
- Staying on top of the latest trends in software development, DevOps tools and cloud advancements.
- Combining trusted battle tested tech with new ideas for something awesome.
- Experimenting in my home labs and cloud playgrounds.
